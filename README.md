# [Antimatter Dimensions: Celestial Mode](https://miabread.github.io/ADCelestialMode/)

Work In Progress save editor for AD!

Some things you can do currently:
- Enable continuum whenever
- Show all tabs or subtabs    
- Unlock celestials

This list is planned to grow!

## Raw Editor Tab

A new tab has been added to directly edit the raw values of your save file. Right now only boolean values can be modified but complete capabilities are in the works.

## Force Flags

"Force flags" have been injected into various unlock conditions throughout the game. When set to true, said unlock will always be true regardless of it's original condition. You can toggle these in the brand new Force tab located at the end of the tab list. These can also be modified in the console by messing around with the newly added `player.force` object.

**A lot of the force-flags will just bug the game!**

Obviously none of this was intended by the developers, so keep that in mind. I'm not going to document how every single flag interacts either. Discovery is part of your fun :)

## Future 

More features will be added as I dig into the code. Feel free to leave an issue or pull request if there's anything you'd like added!
